                <h2>Exploring the Foundation of Inquiry</h2>
                <p>The Origin of Thought axis focuses on the fundamental questions that arise from our personal experience of existence. It is the starting point of philosophical inquiry, where we confront the basic mysteries of being human.</p>
            </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>The Nature of Personal Questions</h3>
                    <p>Every significant philosophical journey begins with a personal questionâ€”a moment when we step back from the flow of everyday experience and ask: What is this? Why am I here? What does it mean to exist?</p>
                    <p>These questions arise not from academic curiosity but from the lived experience of being a conscious entity in a world that often seems mysterious, challenging, or contradictory. They are the seeds from which deeper understanding can grow.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Ontological Concerns</h3>
                    <p>Ontology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of being, existence, or reality. Ontological questions explore what types of entities exist, what categories they fall into, and how they relate to one another.</p>
                    <p>Some fundamental ontological questions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What does it mean to exist?</li>
                        <li>What is the nature of consciousness?</li>
                        <li>What is the relationship between mind and matter?</li>
                        <li>Are there different modes or levels of existence?</li>
                        <li>What is the nature of time and space?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>From Personal to Universal</h3>
                    <p>While the Origin of Thought begins with personal questions, it naturally expands to encompass universal concerns. Our individual experience becomes a gateway to understanding broader patterns and principles.</p>
                    <p>This movement from personal to universal is not merely an intellectual exercise but a lived process of expanding awareness. As we explore our own inner landscape with sincerity and courage, we discover connections to the greater whole.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Personal Inquiry Approach</h3>
                    <p>The Origin of Thought axis emphasizes the importance of direct personal inquiry as the foundation for authentic understanding. Rather than accepting pre-packaged answers or systems, we encourage each individual to engage with fundamental questions from their own lived experience.</p>
                    <p>This approach recognizes that while we can learn from others' insights and discoveries, true understanding comes only through personal engagement with the questions that matter most to us.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>Current Questions</h3>
                    <p>Some of the questions we are currently exploring in the Origin of Thought axis include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who am I beyond my social roles and personal history?</li>
                        <li>What is the nature of the self that experiences consciousness?</li>
                        <li>How do my perceptions shape my understanding of reality?</li>
                        <li>What is the relationship between my individual consciousness and the consciousness of others?</li>
                        <li>What does it mean to live an authentic life aligned with my deepest values?</li>
                    </ul>
